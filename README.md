## 📖 About

**NyaaReads** is a modern, privacy-focused manga reading platform that integrates with the MangaDex API to provide a seamless reading experience. Built with Next.js and React, it offers a clean, responsive interface with zero data collection - everything stays on your device.

> **Important**: NyaaReads is a self-hosted application. You need to deploy your own instance to use it. The project scrapes data from MangaDex and other sources through proxy endpoints.

> **Caution**: NyaaReads is not affiliated with MangaDex or any content providers. This project is for educational purposes. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws and provider terms of service.
